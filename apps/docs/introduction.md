# Welcome to YuqiJS :sparkles:

## FAQ

::: details Does YuqiJS only work in ESM environments?
Yes, YuqiJS is designed to work only for ESM environments instead of both EMS & CJS as it is an outdated standard that is being migrated away from.
:::

::: details What is the best architecture for building E2E Typesafe apps/services?
We recommend a monorepo approach to make type sharing between the backend and frontend easier, [Turborepo](https://turbo.build) is our recommendation for building in a monorepo!
:::

::: details Can I request new features or report bugs?
We'd love to hear from you over on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4tsmYvgWKQ) or [GitHub](https://github.com/unteifu/yuqi)!
:::

::: details Why is the package called YuqiJS?
Yuqi is a member of the K-pop group (G)I-DLE who I stan! The package is named after her because I didn't want to name it something generic like @restful-contract-rpc. And I used her full Korean name (Song Yuqi) in the package logo because 3 is the magic number in design.
