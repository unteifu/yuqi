## What is YuqiJS?

YuqiJS is a contract-first library for building API's. It provides a set of tools to help you build APIs with TypeScript and aims to make the process of building APIs more predictable and maintainable.

## FAQ
<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="What does contract-first mean?">
  Contract-first is a way of defining a "source of truth" for your API. Your API's structure is outputted from a single source, such as it's own package in a monorepo, which prevents accidental changes to your API's structure inside of handlers for example.

  <Accordion title="Why is the package called YuqiJS?">
  Yuqi is a member of the K-pop group (G)I-DLE who I stan! The package is named after her because I didn't want to name it something generic like @restful-contract-rpc. And I used her full Korean name (Song Yuqi) in the package logo because 3 is the magic number in design.

  <Accordion title="Can this be used with CommonJS?">
  No. YuqiJS is designed to work with ES Modules as that is the future of the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem.
